At night, sleep under mosquito nets treated with insecticide to further reduce your risk. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, especially in the evening, can provide an additional layer of protection. Choose accommodations that have screened windows or are air-conditioned to minimize mosquito exposure. Avoid areas with stagnant water, such as ponds and puddles, where mosquitoes breed. If you are prescribed antimalarial pills, take them as directed and do not miss any doses.

Start by choosing a policy that <strong>covers medical emergencies</strong>, as healthcare availability and quality can vary widely across the continent. It's also important to ensure your policy covers <strong>trip cancellations and interruptions</strong>, providing peace of mind if your plans change unexpectedly. Check if your insurance also protects against lost or stolen belongings, which can be a common issue for travelers. If you're planning on engaging in adventure activities, such as safaris or mountain climbing, make sure these are included in your coverage. Another essential aspect is verifying coverage for emergency evacuations, especially if you are traveling to remote areas. Understanding the claims process is also key—know how to make a claim and what documentation you'll need. Always keep a copy of your insurance policy and <strong>emergency contact number handy</strong>. Be aware of any exclusions in your policy to avoid surprises.
